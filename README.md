# Forging Ahead

## <mark style="background-color:blue;">Call for Papers</mark>

We invite you to submit a proposal for the ASIS\&T Midwest Chapter Symposium, **Forging Ahead: Librarianship and Information Services in Times of Technological, Cultural, and Political Changes.** This in-person symposium will be held on Saturday, November 15, 2025, as a pre-conference event for the [88th Annual Meeting of the Association for Information Science and Technology](https://www.asist.org/meetings-events/am/am25/), Crystal City, Virginia.

## <mark style="background-color:blue;">Purpose of the Symposium</mark>

The American Midwest is known for its rugged and resilient nature. Recent developments in information technology and the social and political landscape in the United States and abroad have challenged information professionals to respond with new approaches to their services that emphasize the critical nature of the compassionate information professional and demonstrate alignment with our professional values and ethics in a time where these principles are frequently under attack. In this symposium, a series of short papers will be presented that discuss the potential or real impact of technological, social, and political change on library and information services, including the emergence of new technologies (e.g., generative AI evolving social values, and political prerogatives (e.g., loss of support for certain research agenda, policy and funding challenges for libraries). &#x20;

## <mark style="background-color:blue;">Topics of Interest</mark>

This half-day event will explore how librarians and information professionals are navigating rapidly evolving landscapes. We welcome presentation proposals addressing one or more of the following thematic areas:

1. **Emerging Technologies and Information Services** (e.g., generative AI, human-centered AI in library systems)
2. **Social and Political Change** (e.g., generational shifts in user needs, funding challenges, political restrictions on research)
3. **Shifting Professional Values and Philosophies** (e.g., maintaining core LIS values while complying with anti-DEI laws or other policy constraints)

## <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Who Should Submit?**</mark>

We encourage submissions from a wide range of voices, including students, LIS professionals, and first-time ASIS\&T presenters. Proposals will undergo a light peer review by members of the ASIS\&T Midwest Chapter Leadership Board.

## <mark style="background-color:blue;">Presentation Format</mark>

Each presenter will have 15 minutes to share their work. Presentations may follow a traditional paper format or include interactive elements such as activities or discussions.
